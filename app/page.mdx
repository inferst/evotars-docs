## What are Evotars?

* Evotars are free browser-based avatars in Twitch streams, where viewers and chatters will turn into interactive game-like characters that react to chat and perform commands.
* It’s lightweight and easy to set up, perfect for small streamers who want to engage with their audience and grow their channel.




## Features

* **Active Commands**: Chatters can make evotar `!jump`, `!dash`, `!grow`, `!color`, and more.
* **Channel Rewards**: Chatters can use channel points to do actions like jump or change skin.
* **Chat Bubble and Emotes**: Evotars will show show bubble speeches and emotes, with 7TV emote support.
* **Customization**: Chatters can customize their avatar’s appearance — from color to skin.
* **Raid Support**: Raiders' evotars will 'fall' from the top to welcome the incoming community.
* **Easy to Use**: Web-based, so no downloads or complicated setup needed for OBS.
